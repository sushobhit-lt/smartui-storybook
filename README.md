* [Running Your First StoryBook SmartUI Test](#running-your-first-storybook-smartui-test)


## Pre-requisites

1. Basic understanding of [StoryBook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction) is required.
2. Node version installed should be higher than `14.15.0.` Click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) to know more.

## Steps To Create A SmartUI Project

The first step is to create a project with the application in which we will combine all your builds run on the project. To create a SmartUI Project, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Projects page](https://smartui.lambdatest.com/).
2. Click on the `new project` button.
3. Select the platform as **Web** for executing your `StoryBook` tests.
4. Add name of the project, approvers for the changes found, tags for any filter or easy navigation.
5. Click on the **Submit**.

## Running Your First StoryBook SmartUI Test

### Step 1: Install the Dependencies

Install required NPM modules for `LambdaTest Smart UI StoryBook CLI` in your Frontend project.

```
npm install @lambdatest/smartui-storybook -g
```

### Step 2: Setup with StoryBook

Add the following to your `.storybook/main.js`. You can read more about this here Storybook [Feature flags](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/overview#feature-flags).

```
module.exports = {
  features: {
    buildStoriesJson: true,
  },
};
```

### Step 3: Configure your Project Token

Setup your project token show in the **SmartUI** app after, creating your project.

 <b>For Linux/macOS:</b>
 
  ```
 export PROJECT_TOKEN="123456#1234abcd-****-****-****-************"
  ```

   <b>For Windows:</b>

  ```
  set PROJECT_TOKEN="123456#1234abcd-****-****-****-************"
  ```

## Step 4: Create and Configure SmartUI Config

You can now configure your project settings on using various available options to run your tests with the SmartUI integration. To generate the configuration file, please execute the following command:

```bash
smartui config create .smartui.json
```

Once, the configuration file will be created, you will be seeing the default configuration pre-filled in the configuration file:

```bash
{
  "storybook": {
    "browsers": [
      "chrome",
      "firefox",
      "safari"
      // Add more browser configuration here
    ],
    "resolutions": [
      [1920, 1080]    // Add more view ports to capture here
    ],
    "include": [],    // (Optional) Only compare limited stories
    "exclude": []     // (Optional) Don't compare the stories
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Execute the Tests on SmartUI Cloud using CLI

You can now execute your `StoryBook` components for `Visual Regression Testing` using the following options:. Run the following command to run Visual Regression tests on your Storybook components.

```bash
smartui storybook http://localhost:6006 --config .smartui.json
```

You can also provide path to the storybook-static directory instead of the local Storybook URL. Use `--help` for more information on usage.
